# CustomSTL

Personal approach inspired from MSVC and GNU. Actual implementation is found in "code" folder.

This project deepened my understanding of STL internals, including memory management, iterators, and algorithm efficiency.

I am confident that I can create lightweight versions of these classes and functions or use the existing ones with ease.

Compilation requirements:

- C++20 version
- GCC (Linux or Windows) or MSVC (!no thread support!)

Components not fully operational:

- c_memory.h
- c_algorithm.h
- c_forward_list.h operations (splice/sort/merge)
